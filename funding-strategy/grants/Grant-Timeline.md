---

### Phase 2: First Grant Submissions (2025 Q3-Q4)
**Goal:** Secure first research funding

| Grant | Amount | Submission | Decision | Probability |
|-------|--------|------------|----------|-------------|
| NIH R21 | $275K | 2025-09-30 | 2025-12-31 | 15-20% |
| NSF CISE | $350K | 2025-10-15 | 2026-03-31 | 20% |

- Apply to alternate programs (foundations)
- Continue publication track
- Self-fund with consulting/services

### Risk 2: Publication Rejections
**Mitigation:**
- Submit to multiple journals (cascading IF)
- Use preprints for grant applications
- Ensure technical quality (reproducibility)

### Risk 3: Collaboration Falls Through
**Mitigation:**
- Multiple collaborator pipeline
- Public datasets as backup
- Focus on computational strengths

### Risk 4: Institutional Support Loss
**Mitigation:**
- Multiple institutional affiliations
- Remote collaboration agreements
- Industry partnerships as alternative

## ✅ Decision Points

### March 2025: Continue or Pivot?
**If preliminary data looks weak:**
- Pivot to pure computational methods paper
- Focus on algorithmic innovations
- Target CS journals instead

**If preliminary data is strong:**
- Proceed with neuroscience focus
- Target R21 submission
- Expand dataset validation

---

### December 2025: Funding Outcome
**If R21 awarded:**
- Execute R21 plan (primary path)
- Begin R01 preparation
- Hire postdoc/research assistant

**If no awards:**
- Resubmit R21 (February 2026 cycle)
- Focus on publications
- Seek foundation grants

---

### June 2026: R01 Decision
**If track record strong (3+ papers, R21 active):**
- Proceed with R01 submission (February 2027)
- Expand aims (multi-site clinical)
- Large budget ($1.75M+)

**If track record moderate (1-2 papers):**
- Delay R01 to 2027 Q4
- Focus on additional publications
- Alternative: NSF NeuroNex or ERC
