# NIH R21 Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Strategy

**Grant Type:** R21 (Exploratory/Developmental)
**Funding Amount:** Up to $275,000 total costs (2 years)
**Timeline:** 6 months preparation → submission
**Success Rate:** 15-20%
**Target Submission:** September 2025

## Overview

The R21 mechanism supports exploratory/developmental research that has high potential impact but is high-risk. It's ideal for CORTEXIA because:

✅ **Less emphasis on preliminary data** (vs R01)
✅ **Accepts computational approaches**
✅ **Supports novel methodology development**
✅ **Shorter project period** (2 years vs 5)
✅ **Lower budget** ($275K total vs $1-2M+)

**Meets Requirements:**
- ✅ Novel computational approach (CORTEXIA framework)

- ✅ Feasibility demonstrated (working software)

**Gaps to Address:**
- ⚠️ Need institutional affiliation (adjunct/visiting)
- ⚠️ Need preliminary results on real data
